D. student of Prof. Dr. Katharina Morik at the Artificial Intelligence Unit of University of Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany. He received his Diplom in Computer Science from the University of Dortmund in 1998. In 1994/95 he studied at University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) in Rolla, Missouri, USA, for a year with a grant of the German-American Fulbright Commission. In 1996 he completed his studies at UMR as a Master of Science in Computer Science. His research interests are in the fields of machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery, with a focus on learning drifting concepts from time-varying data streams and machine learning with text. In 1992 he won a price in the national German computer science competition \"Bundeswettbewerb Informatik\" for pupils and young students organized by the German Informatics society (GI)"}, "score": 5739.4414, "sourcetype": "", "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Data Mining", "Knowledge Discovery", "Learning Algorithms", "Concept Drift", "Support Vector Machines", "Information Filtering", "Model Selection", "Use Cases", "Rapid Prototyping", "Business Analytics", "Feature Space", "User Feedback", "Rule Set", "in Business", "Concept Drift", ".
